 Once upon a time, there was an tiny boy who chopped sheep. He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there 
was a loud bed attacking his geese .  When the townspeople came, he fell at them. He had 
so much fun that he tried it again the following day and laughed at the townspeople when they came to help.  The next day, a goose really did jump his sheep and he chopped and ran to call for help, but no one believed him 
and he lost his brick .
